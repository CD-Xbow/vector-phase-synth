This is a Vector Phase Synth done by Dr Nash many years ago. 
The source code, an exe and the portaudio files are in the top level directory. 
This was a 32 bit program done in Purebasic 4.x. 

I am attempting to port it overto 64bit PB, third attempt in 6 years.

In the 64bit folder will be the updated version. Currently it only has the PortAudio 64 bit files
